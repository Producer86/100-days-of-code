# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<h3>
Hello,
</h3>
And welcome to the logs of my 100 days of code challenge!

My name is TB, at the time of writing this I'm a freelance software developer and there's a language, R, which I use relatively often, but our relationship is not cloudless, so I'm starting this challenge to improve it.

Also, I want to work on my barely existent statistical skills, because I could see good use of them and anyways yay doing science. :D

The plan is to work my way through the
[R Manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)
first, the language definition and the internals, to get a bit better feel for what's going on under the hood.
Then I saw [Computer Age Statistical Inference](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) and [Machine Learning for Hackers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do) recommended, which both seems a hell of a lot of fun indeed.

Now, given that I move along books which involves a lot of reading and also don't know how beefy is the math in them, so there's a chance there will be times when I don't actually write code but instead figure out the math or just, you know, read. But as long as I keep up with the logs it should be fine I think. We shall see!

Cheers,
TB
